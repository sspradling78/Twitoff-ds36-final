## Twitter API app for Unit 3 Sprint 3

Twitoff is for comparisions of two users' tweets.
When given a hypothetical tweet we then utilize
vectorization to change text into an array of
numbers. We then setup a Logistical Regression
model to then predict which user would be more
likely to tweet the hypothetical tweet.
